Today I learned

Sinatra can return a json object with $.get will recognize as a json if you include
content_type :json

before its submitted


#NOTHING HELPFUL TIP
Always make sure your in rerun. Otherwise your app server doesn't update

#HELPFUL TIP #3
use $ lsof -i TCP:4567
and then use kill __PROCESS_ID__
to find rogue server processes

#HElpful tip#4
When using rufus to run a demon make sure to 1. increase the available database pool
2. user Rack::Session::Pool instead of enable: :sessions
It has avoided the 'Cookie over 4k' error I was getting


#Tip #5
MonogoDB can be used to store our session data. It is as simple as installing the app
and use Rack::Session::Mongo
Another neat side note to stop the activerecord connection failure add this to the config.ru
use ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::ConnectionManagement
